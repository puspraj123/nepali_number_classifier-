# Nepali Number Classifier (Clustering Based)

## About the Project
This project focuses on clustering Nepali handwritten number images using
unsupervised learning techniques. The main objective is to group visually
similar digits without using any predefined labels and analyze how clustering
works on image data.

This project was completed using Google Colab as part of my data science /
machine learning coursework.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## Methodology
The following steps were followed in this project:

1. Loading handwritten Nepali number images
2. Converting images to grayscale and resizing them
3. Flattening image pixels into numerical feature vectors
4. Applying K-Means clustering to group similar images
5. Saving clustered images into separate folders

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains handwritten Nepali numbers including:
- Digits 0–9
- Nepali characters PA and BAA

All preprocessing and analysis were done inside Google Colab.

---

## How to Run
1. Open `final_project.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Run all the cells sequentially
3. Clustered output folders will be generated automatically

## Learning Outcome
Through this project, I learned:
- Basic image preprocessing techniques
- Feature extraction from images
- Practical use of K-Means clustering
- Organizing machine learning outputs effectively
